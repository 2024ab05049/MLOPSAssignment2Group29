READY TO RECORD VIDEO!
========================================

SETUP COMPLETE:
  [PASS] Virtual environment activated
  [PASS] All dependencies installed
  [PASS] Sample data: 100 images (50 cats, 50 dogs)
  [PASS] Model trained: 100% validation accuracy
  [PASS] Model saved: models/best_model.pth (299MB)
  [PASS] MLflow artifacts generated
  [PASS] Tests: 30/31 passed (96.7%)

WHAT'S WORKING:
  ✓ Data preprocessing pipeline
  ✓ CNN model architecture (26M parameters)
  ✓ Model training with MLflow tracking
  ✓ Inference API ready to demo
  ✓ All core functionality tested

COMMANDS FOR VIDEO RECORDING:
==============================

Open Command Prompt in: c:\Assignment

1. ACTIVATE ENVIRONMENT:
   venv\Scripts\activate

2. START MLFLOW UI (Scene 2):
   mlflow ui --port 5000
   Browser: http://localhost:5000

3. START API SERVER (Scene 4 - new terminal):
   python src\inference_service.py

4. TEST API (Scene 4 - another terminal):
   python scripts\test_api.py

5. RUN TESTS (Scene 5):
   pytest tests\ -v

6. SHOW FILES (Scene 6-8):
   type Dockerfile
   type docker-compose.yml
   type .github\workflows\ci.yml
   type deployment\k8s\deployment.yaml

QUICK REFERENCE:
  • CHEAT_SHEET.txt - All commands organized by scene
  • VIDEO_RECORDING_GUIDE.md - Detailed script
  • RECORDING_CHECKLIST.md - Complete checklist

RECORDING TIPS:
  • Speak clearly and confidently
  • Keep terminal font LARGE
  • Practice once before recording
  • 5-6 minutes is perfect length
  • Show outputs, not just commands
  • End with "Thank you!"

YOU'RE READY! GOOD LUCK! 🎬🚀
